# MyntraTrendcraft ðŸŒŸ
Welcome to MyntraTrendcraft, a cutting-edge project developed for a hackathon that merges fashion forecasting with interactive technology. This repository contains the codebase for a website where users can predict future fashion trends, participate in a community discussion, and explore trend predictions powered by machine learning.
Project Overview
MyntraTrendcraft is an innovative platform that aims to predict the next big trends in fashion using a combination of interactive gameplay and data science. The project features:

Model Dress-Up Game: Engage in a fun and interactive game where users can dress up a virtual model with the latest fashion items. 

Community Page: A dedicated space for users to discuss fashion, share ideas, and explore trends together. This community-driven feature fosters collaboration and insight into whatâ€™s hot in the fashion world.

Trend Prediction Using Machine Learning: A sophisticated ML model using the Random Forest algorithm runs in the background, analyzing an example dataset to predict upcoming fashion trends. This predictive model provides insights based on data-driven decisions.

Features
Interactive Trend Prediction: Users play a game to dress up a model, helping to predict future trends.
Community Engagement: A platform for fashion enthusiasts to discuss and explore upcoming styles.
Machine Learning Insights: A Random Forest model predicts trends using an example dataset, offering users a glimpse into the future of fashion.
Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Machine Learning: Python, Scikit-learn (Random Forest algorithm)
Database: MySQL/PostgreSQL 

How It Works
Model Dress-Up: Users interact with the model dress-up game, making fashion choices that feed into the trend prediction algorithm.
Community Page: Engage with other users, share insights, and see what others are predicting.
ML Trend Prediction: The Random Forest model analyzes user interactions and an example dataset to forecast fashion trends.
